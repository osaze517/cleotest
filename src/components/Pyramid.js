                    <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway metaverse, a ship of eager adventurers sailed the oceans in search of new worlds. The ship's cabin boy shouted, “Land ho! Land ho!” and the ship moored at a large, uninhabited island. By a stroke of luck, this island had an overabundance of gold deposits, so the adventurers turned into Goldminers. They ferried gold bars to the mainland and grew rich enough to hire helpers. But their fortune didn't last long. Treasure-seeking pirates heard about an island that offered a wealth of riches, and they promptly hurried to the island to rob any passing ships!</p>
                <p>No one could stop the fearsome Pirates and the robberies that took place from day to day, from hour to hour. So the island's Governor signed a treaty with the Pirates: the Goldminers would pay the Pirates a fee with $GGOLD mined for safe sailing up to the mainland. But if a Goldminer returns to the mainland and no longer wants to pay the fee, the Pirates would rob that Goldminer blind if they caught up with them.</p>

                <p>Gold Hunt is a homage to the famous Wolf Game, which was hugely popular but had to deviate from the original plan and stop selling tokens. We coveted the best parts from the original game and brought the fight to a new reality, where barbaric Pirates and courageous Goldminers fight for gold on Treasure Island. Most of the mechanics will be well-known to those who've played before. So we invite you to delve into the revived and incredibly exciting adventure in order to play to the end, because we have fixed all the bugs and vulnerabilities of the original game that inspired us.</p>
